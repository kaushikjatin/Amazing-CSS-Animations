1) All properties of parent are not inherited by the child eg-> border,background-image,display-type etc are not inherited.

2) Setting height and width donot include margin,padding, border in it. It only include content. But you can change it by box-sizing='border-box' property.....what it does it....it include the padding and margin too to the height and the width.

3) When you put an image inside a text .....then you use the 'vertical-align' property on the image to change the alignment of text along the width...normally the text lies along the bottom of image..but if you set vertcal-align as top...then the text lies along the top of the image...

4) We can control the overflow of a block elemtn by the over-flow property.....Overflow property can be applied only on the block elements with a fixed height...otherwise the height would change and overflow wouldnot occur.It can have multiple values like-> hidden, scroll, visible,inherit etc.

5) We know that setting the width and height of image mostly changes it's height to width ratio and make it to look dull,, hence we have 2 proprty to keep the aspect ratio and thr part of image we want to see...they are 'object-fit' and 'object-position'. These 2 properties can be applied either on an image or a video.

6) Display properties of an element:
   Block 				(new line		full width		have height and width)..remember whether you set width of a block element...the next element will start from a new line
   Inline 				(same line		not full		no height and width)
   Inline-Block 		(same line		not full		have height and width)
   None					(It means when display is set to None,,,,it will not be rendered on page...i'e no space will be taken....but visibility="hidden" is different....in this					 the element is rendered but not visible...i.e it will take space. )


7)Position property of an element:


	Positioned element-> An element is said to be positioned when it's position is either reativer,fixed or absolute......
	*Static 		(normal flow of the website,,no top,bottom, etc available)

	*Relative (It will move relative to it's position and it donot allow anyone else to occupy it's previous position too)    
					top 
					bottom
					left 
					right
	*Fixed     
					top 
					bottom
					left 
					right
	*Absolute (It will move acc to nearest positioned parent,,,and if no positioned parent then it is moved w.r.t body.....the element leaves it's position as soon as it is marked absolute and another element takes it's place.....but remember that if none of left,right,top,bottom is set then also it's position is occupied by another element and th element then overlaps with the other element)    
					top 
					bottom
					left 
					right



8) Align-itm and justify content works when the container is set flex
		align-items: center; 					(set the element in vertical center)
        justify-content: center;				(set the element in horizontal center)



   																		****Properties Of CSS and Meanings****
1) Box-Sizing
			When we change height and width of element then, it donot include the margin , border etc into the height and width, so border box can help in that.


2) Overflow 
			It is only applicable to block elements with specified height.
			Comes handy when our content is greater than the size of the element. SO in that case when can set overflow property and can select how we want to show overflowed part. 

3) Min-Height
			It set the min-height of the element. If content is smaller the height-of element is set to min0height. If the content is larger then the min-height property has no effect.

4) Animation
			It lets us to change an element gradually from one style to another. To specify animation we must speify the keyframes. The keyframes denote the styles which our element will take at certain time. For the animation ot work we have to first bind the element by the animation tag.
			Use this link for more info -> https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp

5) Transform 
			This property contain various functions which we can apply like scaling , tranlate , rotate etc.
			Use this link for info -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function

6) Z-index
			It only works on the positioned elements or flex-elements(i.e elements that are direct children of display:flex elements)
			More the z-index , more will be its priority to remain on top.


7) ::brfore 
			The ::before selector inserts something before the content of each selected element(s).
			eg-> body::before
			{
			 content: 'resd this'
			}	this will append specified content befire the content of body...and apply the specified styles.

8) Transition
			Property smoothens the changing of the element styles on hover. Either you explicitly specify the property on which you want to apply transition or the transition will be applied to all the properties which changes on hover or any other mouse-event or any event.


8) Flexbox 
		display : flex ,,, it really means(display : block flex),, which means the parent container will be a block element and the childrem will take part in flex layout.
		display : inline-flex ,, it really means that parent will be a inline element and children will take part in flex layout.
		justify-content : This property is set to theelement whose displayis set flex. This property helps in deciding the spacing and aligmenet of children.It contols 
							aligment on the main axis.
		align-itmes : This is similar to the justify content. But it controls the alignment on the cross-axis.


9)********* (--)
	style='--proprty_name:property_value'
	using -- before any style will make a custom property and whose value can be accessed and used in the css file by the help of var().
	eg-> <span style='--i:2'>
	span
	{
	transform:rotate(var(i));
	}


10)box-shadow   refer here-> https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/
		box-shadow: [horizontal offset] [vertical offset] [blur radius] [optional spread radius] [color];


11) filter:hue-rotate(10deg)
			This function changes the colour rgb-values.You can consider that the value of a color which was at 60deg will be now at 70deg,,i/e suppose yellow will change in red.  The color values of all the children (of elements on which this filter-hue-rotate() is applied) will be changed.
